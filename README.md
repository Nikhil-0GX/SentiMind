How It Works
Sentimind uses a machine learning model that has been trained on millions of text samples to recognize patterns associated with different emotional tones. The process works in these steps:

User submits text for analysis
The text is processed by a DistilBERT model fine-tuned for sentiment classification
The model evaluates the text and determines if it expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
Results are displayed to the user with appropriate visual indicators
